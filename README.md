# NeoCal - Google Calendar Command Line Interface

**NeoCal** is a Rust application that allows you to access your Google Calendar(s) from a command line. It uses Google Apps Script platform to build his own data source, making
it less complicated to setup than using OAUTH config tokens.

## Installation

You can either install it via `cargo` or download the binaries from GitHub releases.

If you go the `cargo` route, you need to have it installed (usually using [rustup](https://rustup.rs)). In a terminal, run this command to install `neocal`:

```
cargo install neocal
```
Then you'll be able to run `neocal` from whichever directory you in.

### SetUp
